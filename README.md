Welcome to the Healthcare Assistant Chatbot project! This is an interactive web application that provides users with health-related assistance using AI. The chatbot offers fast, accurate, and context-aware responses, including emergency alerts, symptom analysis, medication information, and appointment scheduling. It leverages Streamlit for the user interface and Hugging Face's GPT-2 for generating conversational responses.

Key Features:
Emergency Response: Identifies critical health symptoms and immediately suggests seeking medical attention.
Symptom Analysis: Requests further details on symptoms and provides general health advice.
Medication Guidance: Offers information on medications, including side effects and interactions.
General Health Queries: Uses the GPT-2 model to generate responses for a wide variety of health-related questions.
User Profile: Users can optionally enter their personal medical information (e.g., age, conditions) for informational purposes.

Technologies Used:
Streamlit: A framework to build the user interface (UI) and create interactive web applications.
Transformers (Hugging Face): Utilizes the GPT-2 model to generate text-based responses for user queries.
Python: The primary programming language for backend development.
nltk: Natural Language Processing toolkit (imported for future enhancements).

Prerequisites:
Python 3.7 or later
Streamlit: Used for creating the interactive web interface.
Transformers: Hugging Face library to load the GPT-2 model.
nltk: For potential NLP enhancements.
